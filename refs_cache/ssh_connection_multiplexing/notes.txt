ssh -N -f host


opens a connection and goes into the background without executing a remote command so you don't need to keep a window or shell running locally just to keep that connection.


greetings, eMBee. 

':' is not a legal character in path names,
try instead

ControlPath ~/.ssh/master-%r@%h.%p

Also, isn't the whole point of putting ControlPath in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.ssh/config to make the '-S ' argument uneccessary? And doesn't the 'ControlMaster auto' also make the toggling -M uneccessary? 

You can simply make ssh hang around in the background with this command:
ssh -fMN <hostname>

You can set it to autoask instead of auto to have ssh prompt you for whether or not to reuse an existing connection.

The configuration directive ControlPath tells ssh where it should keep its socket information. I've chosen to put these files in /tmp, however it may be best to put this into your own home directory on multi-user systems. 

NOTE: You will need to specify -o ControlMaster=no when using ssh to do ssh tunneling otherwise multiple tunnels to a particular host will not work.
